                <li>The collision theory of reacting particles postulates that: <ul>
                        <li>Reacting particles must collide before a chemical reaction occurs</li>
                        <li>Not all collisions are effective/ result in chemical reaction</li>
                        <li><strong>Only those particles with sufficient energy result in effective collisions i.e.
                                energy equal to or&nbsp;greater than the activation energy.</strong></li>
                        <li>Any factor, which increases the rate of a chemical reaction, does so by increasing the
                            number of&nbsp;effective collisions;</li>

                <li>It refers to the energy an energy barrier that must be overcome by the reactants to be converted

            <ul>
                <li>Factors that increase the rate of a reaction does so by: <ul>
                        <li>Increasing number of effective collisions;</li>
                        <li>Lowering the activation energy; since a reaction with high activation energy is slow at

                    </ul>
                </li>

                        <li>Increase in concentration of one of the reactants increases the rate of the
                            reaction;<br><strong>Reason:</strong></li>
                        <li>Higher concentration results in a greater probability of collision hence a higher rate of
                            reaction<br><strong>Example: reaction between Mg<sub>(s)</sub> and 2M and 4M hydrochloric

                        <li>The maximum volume of a gas collected in both experiments is the same because the number

                        <li>Curve for 4M HCl is steeper indicating a faster rate because the acid is more concentration

                            a shorter time&nbsp;to go to completion</li>
                        <li>The start of the flat part of the curve indicates the end of the

                        <li>Reactants with 4M HCl will disappear faster;</li>
                        <li>Curve for a faster reaction rate is always to the left of the reference

                        <li>Presence of a catalyst has no effect on the position of the equilibrium but alters the rate
                            at which the&nbsp;equilibrium is attained.</li>
                        <li>Catalysts usually allow the equilibrium to be reached in a shorter period of time by
                            increasing the&nbsp;rates of the reactions</li>

                <li>States that:<br><em>When stress is applied to a system in equilibrium, the system reacts so as to
                        oppose the stress.</em></li>
                <li><em></em>This implies that when a change in condition is applied to a system in equilibrium, the
                    system moves&nbsp;so as to oppose the change.<br><strong>Note:</strong></li>
                <li>The effect of different factors on equilibrium was first investigated in 1888 by a French
                    Chemist;&nbsp;<strong>Henri Louis Le Chatelier</strong>.</li>

                <li>The ability to change the position of an equilibrium by varying the conditions has been important
                    in&nbsp;industrial processes as industrialists aim at obtaining maximum products at minimum cost and
                    shortest&nbsp;time possible.</li>
                <li>Conditions required to obtain greatest yield of products at minimum costs and shortest
                    time&nbsp;possible are called optimum conditions .</li>
                <li>Such optimum conditions are obtained by continuous removal of products hence reduction in
                    its&nbsp;concentration or varying external factors like temperature and
                    pressure.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></li>
