                <li>Genetics is the study of inheritance.</li>
                <li>The fact that the offspring of any species resemble the parents indicates that the&nbsp;characters
                    in the parents are passed on to the offspring.</li>
                <li>Factors that determine characters (genes) are passed on from parent to offspring&nbsp;through
                    gametes or sex cells.</li>
                <li>In fertilisation the nucleus of the male gamete fuses with the nucleus of the&nbsp;female gamete.
                </li>
                <li>The offspring show the characteristics of both the male and the female.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The term variation means to differ from a standard.</li>
                <li>Genetics alsodeals with the study of differences between organisms belonging to&nbsp;one species.
                </li>
                <li>Organisms belonging to higher taxonomic groups e.g. phyla or classes are clearly&nbsp;different.
                </li>
                <li>Although organisms belonging to the same species are similar, they show a&nbsp;number of differences
                    or variations such that no two organisms are exactly the&nbsp;same in every respect.</li>
                <li>Even identical twins, though similar in many aspects, are seen to differ if they&nbsp;grow in
                    different environments.</li>
                <li>Their differences are as a result of the environment which modifies the&nbsp;expression of their
                    genetic make-up or genotype.</li>
                <li>The two causes of variations are the genes and the environment.</li>
                <li>Genes determine the character while the environment modifies the expression of&nbsp;that character.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a id="ContinuousandDiscontinuousVariation">Continuous and Discontinuous Variation</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Continuous Variations</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The differences between the individual are not clear-cut.</li>
                <li>There are intermediates or gradations between any two extremes.</li>
                <li>Continuous variations are due to action of many genes e.g. skin complexion in&nbsp;humans.</li>
                <li>In continuous variation, the environment has a modifying effect in that it may&nbsp;enhance or
                    suppress the expressions of the genes.</li>
                <li>Continuous variation can be represented in form of a histogram.</li>
                <li>Example of continuous variation in humans is weight, height and skin&nbsp;complexion.</li>
                <li>Linear measurements:</li>
                <li>In humans, height shows gradation from tall, to tallest.</li>
                <li>So does the length of mature leaves of a plant.</li>
                <li>In most cases, continuous variation is as a result of the environment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Discontinuous Variations</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>These are distinct and clear cut differences within a species.</li>
                <li>Examples include: <ul>
                        <li>Ability to roll the tongue.</li>
                        <li>An individual can either roll the tongue or not.</li>
                        <li>Ability to taste phenylthiourea (PTC); some individuals can taste this chemical&nbsp;others
                            cannot.</li>
                        <li>Blood groups - and individual has one of the four blood groups A, B AB or O.&nbsp;There are
                            no intermediates.</li>
                        <li>Albinism - one is either an albino or not.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Discontinuous variations is determined by the action of a single gene present in&nbsp;an individual.
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>These are threadlike structures found in the nucleus.</li>
                <li>They are normally very thin and coiled and are not easily visible unless the cell is&nbsp;dividing.
                </li>
                <li>When a cell is about to divide, the chromosomes uncoil and thicken.</li>
                <li>Their structure, number and behaviour is clearly observed during the process of&nbsp;cell division.
                </li>
                <li>The number of chromosomes is the same in all the body cells of an organism.</li>
                <li>In the body cells, the chromosomes are found in pairs.</li>
                <li>Each pair is made up of two identical chromosomes that make up a homologous&nbsp;pair.</li>
                <li>However sex chromosomes in human male are an exception in that the&nbsp;Y- chromosome is smaller.
                </li>

            <h3><a id="NumberofChromosomes">Number of Chromosomes</a></h3>
            <h4>Diploid Number (2n)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>This is the number of chromosomes found in somatic cells.</li>
                <li>For example, in human 2n = 46 or 22 pairs (44 chromosomes) are known as&nbsp;autosomes (body
                    chromosomes")&nbsp;while 1 pair is known as the sex chromosomes.</li>
                <li>In Drosophila melanogaster, 2n = 8.</li>

            <h3><a id="ChromosomeStructure">Chromosome Structure</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All chromosomes are not of the same size or shape.</li>
                <li>In human beings; each of the twenty three pairs have unique size and structure .</li>
                <li>On this basis they have been numbered 1 to 23.</li>
                <li>The sex chromosomes formthe 23rd pair.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a id="PropertiesofChromosomes">Properties of Chromosomes</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Chromosomes are very long and thin.</li>
                <li>They are greatly and loosely coiled and fit within the nucleus.</li>
                <li>During cell division they shorten, become thicker and are easily observable.</li>
                <li>Each consists of two chromatids.</li>
                <li>The two chromatids are held at same position along the length, at the&nbsp;centromere.</li>
                <li>Chromatids separate during cell division in mitosis and in the second stage of&nbsp;meiosis.</li>
                <li>Chromosomes take most dyes and stain darker than any other part of the cell.</li>
                <li>This property has earned them the name "chromatin material"</li>
                <li>Each chromosome is made up of the following components: <ul>
                        <li>Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) - this carries the genes.&nbsp;It is the major component of the
                            genetic material.</li>
                        <li>Protein e.g. histones.</li>
                        <li>Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is present in very small amounts.</li>
                        <li>Enzymes concerned with DNA and RNA replication - these are DNA and RNA&nbsp;polymerases and
                            ligases.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The structure of DNA was first explained in 1953 by Watson and Crick.</li>
                <li>DNA was shown to be a double helix that coils around itself.</li>
                <li>The two strands are parallel and the distance between the two is constant.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a id="ComponentsofDNA">Components of DNA</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>DNA is made up of repeating units called nucleotides.</li>
                <li>Each nucleotide is composed of: <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                        <li>A five-carbon sugar (deoxyribose).</li>
                        <li>Phosphate molecule.</li>
                        <li>Nitrogenous base, four types are available i.e, <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                                <li>Adenine - (A)</li>
                                <li>Guanine - (G)</li>
                                <li>Cytosine - (C)</li>
                                <li>Thymine - (T)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The bases are represented by their initials as A, G, C and T respectively.</li>
                <li>The sugar alternates with the phosphate, and the two form the backbone of the&nbsp;strands.</li>
                <li>The bases combine in a specific manner, such that Adenine pairs with Thymine&nbsp;and Guanine pairs
                    with Cytosine.</li>
                <li>The bases are held together by hydrogen bonds. A gene is the basic unit of&nbsp;inheritance
                    consisting of a number of bases in linear sequence on the DNA.</li>
                <li>Genes exert their effect through protein synthesis.</li>
                <li>The sequence of bases that make up a gene determine the arrangement of&nbsp;amino acids to make a
                    particular protein.</li>
                <li>The proteins manufactured are used to make cellular structures as well as&nbsp;hormones and enzymes.
                </li>
                <li>The types of proteins an organism manufactures determines its characteristics.</li>
                <li>For example, albinism is due to failure of the cells of an organism to synthesise&nbsp;the enzyme
                    tyrosine required for the formation of the pigment melanin.</li>

            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>It is also known as <strong>Law of Segregation (Mendel's First Law)</strong>.</li>
                <li>The characters of an organism are controlled by genes occurring in pairs known&nbsp;as
                    <strong>Alleles</strong>.</li>
                <li>By definition, an allele is an alternative form of a gene controlling a
                    particular&nbsp;characteristic.&nbsp;Of a pair of such alleles, only one is carried in each gamete.
                </li>
                <li>This is explained by first meiotic anaphase stage, when the homologous&nbsp;chromosomes are
                    separated so that each carries one of the allelic genes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="spaced"><a id="MonohybridInheritance">Monohybrid Inheritance</a></h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>This is the study of the inheritance of one character trait that is represented by a&nbsp;pair of
                    genes on homologous chromosomes.</li>
                <li>Gregor Mendel (an Austrian monk) was the first person to show the nature of&nbsp;inheritance.</li>
                <li>He did this through a series of experiments using the garden pea, Pisum sativum.</li>
                <li>As opposed to others before him, the success in his work lay in the fact that:</li>
                <li>He chose to study first a single character at a time (monohybrid inheritance).</li>
                <li>He then proceeded to study two characters at time (dihybrid inheritance) .</li>
                <li>He quantified his results by counting the number of offspring bearing each trait.</li>
                <li>Each character he chose was expressed in two clearly contrasting forms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stem length: some plants were tall while others were short.</li>
                <li>Colour of unripe pods: some were green, others yellow.&nbsp;There were no intermediates.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a id="MendelsProcedure">Mendel's Procedure</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For each character, Mendel chose a plant that bred true.</li>
                <li>A true or pure breed continues to show a particular trait in all the offspring in&nbsp;several
                    successive generations of self-fertilisation.</li>
                <li>He made one plant to act as the female by removing the stamens before the&nbsp;ovary was mature and
                    protecting (e.g. by wrapping with paper).</li>
                <li>The female plant from contact with any stray pollen.</li>
                <li>When the ovary was mature, he carefully dusted pollen from the anthers of the&nbsp;selected male
                    plant and transferred it to the stigma of the female plant.</li>
                <li>Observations were then made on the resulting seeds or on the plants obtained&nbsp;when those seeds
                    were planted.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Results</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>For each pair of contrasting characters he studied, Mendel obtained the same&nbsp;results.</li>
                <li>For example, when he crossed pure breeding tall plants with pure breeding short&nbsp;plants, the
                    first offspring, known as the <strong>first filial generation (F<sub>1</sub>)</strong> were all
                    tall.</li>
                <li>When these were selfed i.e. self-fertilisation allowed to take place, the second&nbsp;generation
                    offspring also know as the <strong>second filial generation</strong> or
                    <strong>F<sub>2</sub></strong> occurred&nbsp;in the ratio of 3 tall:1 short.</li>
                <li>The same ratio was obtained for each of the other characters studied.</li>
                <li>From this it is clear that one character i.e. tall is <strong>dominant </strong>over the
                    short&nbsp;character.</li>
                <li>A dominant character is that which is expressed alone in the offspring even when&nbsp;the opposite
                    character is represented in the genotype.</li>
                <li>The unexpressed character is said to be <strong>recessive</strong>.</li>
                <li>From these results and others obtained when he studied two characters at the&nbsp;same time, Mendel
                    concluded that gametes carry factors that are expressed in&nbsp;the offspring.</li>
                <li>These factors are what we know today as genes.</li>
                <li>Mendel put forward the following laws of inheritance: <ul>
                        <li>Of a pair of contrasting characters, only one can be represented in a gamete.</li>
                        <li>For two or more pairs of such contrasting characters, each factor (gene) in the&nbsp;gamete
                            acts independently of the others and may combine randomly with either&nbsp;of the factors of
                            another pair during fertilisation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Genetic experiments carried out to date confirm Mendel's Laws of inheritance&nbsp;e.g. T.H. Morgan's
                    work on inheritance in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The genes present in an individual. The genetic constitution of an&nbsp;individual. It is expressed
                    in alphabetical notation.e.g TT,Tt&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Phenotype</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The observed character or appearance i.e. the expression of the genes in the&nbsp;structure and
                    physiology of the organism.</li>
                <li>&nbsp;In some cases the phenotype is the product of the genotype and the&nbsp;environment. Phenotype
                    is expressed in words.eg TALL,SHORT,RED WHITE .etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Alleles</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>These are alternative forms of the same gene that control a pair of&nbsp;contrasting characters e.g.
                    tall and short.</li>
                <li>They are found at the same position or <strong>gene - locus</strong> on each chromosome in
                    a&nbsp;<strong>homologous</strong> pair.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Homozygous</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This is a state where the alleles in an individual are similar e.g. TT (for tall)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Heterozygous</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This is a state where the alleles are dissimilar i.e. each of the two genes&nbsp;responsible for a
                    pair of contrasting characters are present&nbsp;e.g. Tt. (T for tall; t for short)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Hybrid</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This is the offspring resulting from crossing of two individuals withcontrasting characters.</li>

            <p><strong>Hybrid vigour or Heterosis</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The hybrid develops the best characteristics from both parents&nbsp;i.e. it is stronger or

            <h3><a id="UseofSymbols">Use of Symbols</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To represent genes in the chromosomes, letters are used.</li>
                <li>It is customary to use a capital letter for the dominant characteristic and small&nbsp;letter for
                    the recessive one.</li>
                <li>The gametes are encircled.</li>
                <li>For example,a cross between a tall and a short pea plant is illustrated as&nbsp;follows; <ul>
                        <li>Let – T- represent gene for tallness.</li>

                                <li>The diploid number changes to 3n (triploid) or 4n (tetraploid) and so on.</li>
                                <li>This results from the doubling of the chromosome number in the gamete&nbsp;(2n).

                                <li>This is due to failure of the chromosome sets to separate during meiosis.</li>
                                <li>The phenomenon is known as polyploidy.</li>
                                <li>It is common in plant's and has been employed artificially to produce&nbsp;varieties
                                    of crops with hybrid vigour e.g. bread wheat is hexaploid (6n). (This is

                <li>It is due to gene mutation caused by substitution of the base adenine for&nbsp;thymine.</li>
                <li>The result is the inclusion of the amino acid valine (in place of glutamic&nbsp;acid) in the

                <li>Each is rolled to appear long is and coiled, prophase is each made into a ball&nbsp;and then shaped
                    to the appropriate length; and split into two to represent&nbsp;chromatids.</li>
                <li>Centromeres for different chromosomes can be illustrated in different&nbsp;positions.</li>
                <li>Each stage of mitosis is illustrated and telophase can be illustrated by&nbsp;surrounding the
                    "chromosomes" with a long many drawn plasticene to&nbsp;represent cell membrane.</li>
                <li>It is manipulated to show how telophase takes place.</li>
