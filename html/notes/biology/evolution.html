            <ul>
                <li>Evolution is the development of organisms from pre-existing simple&nbsp;organisms over a long period
                    of time.</li>
                <li>It is based on the similarities in structure and function that is observed in all&nbsp;organisms.
                </li>
                <li>All are made up of cells, and similar chemical compounds are present.</li>
                <li>This indicates that all organism may have had a common origin.</li>
                <li>Evolution seeks to explain the diversity of life and also to answer the question&nbsp;as to the
                    origin of life, as well as its present state.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Human beings have tried to explain how life began.</li>
                <li>Currently held views are listed below: <ul>
                        <li>Special creation -life was created by a supernatural being within a particular&nbsp;time.
                        </li>
                        <li>Spontaneous generation life originated from non-living matter all at once. e.g.&nbsp;maggots
                            arise from decaying meat.</li>
                        <li>Steady state - life has no origin.</li>
                        <li>Cosmozoan - life on earth originate from elsewhere, outer space.</li>
                        <li>Bio-chemical evolution-life originated according to chemical and physical laws.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Only special creation and chemical evolution will be discussed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="spaced"><a id="SpecialCreation">Special Creation</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The earliest idea is that of special creation which is recorded in the old&nbsp;testament (Genesis
                    1: 1-26).</li>
                <li>It states that God created the world and all living things in six days.</li>
                <li>Some hold the six days literally, while others say it may represent thousands&nbsp;of years.</li>
                <li>According to his theory, the earth and all organisms were created mature.</li>
                <li>Similarities in structure and function denote the stamp of a "common&nbsp;Designer"</li>
                <li>Evidence for this view arises from observations of life itself.</li>
                <li>Faith explains it all.</li>
                <li>By faith we understand that the universe was created by the command of&nbsp;God.</li>
                <li>Several scientists hold this view and their research confirms accounts in the&nbsp;old testament of
                    a universal flood explains the disappearance of dinosaurs as&nbsp;vegetation decreased.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="spaced"><a id="ChemicalEvolution">Chemical Evolution</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The following is the line of thought held in this view to explain origin of life:</li>
                <li>The composition of atmospheric gases was different from what it is today</li>
                <li>There was less oxygen, more carbon (IV) oxide, hence no ozone layers to filter the ultra-violet
                    light.</li>
                <li>The high solar energy reached the earth and brought together hydrogen,&nbsp;carbon (IV) oxide and
                    nitrogen to make organic compounds.</li>
                <li>These were: hydrocarbons, amino acids, nucleic acids, sugars, amino acids and&nbsp;proteins.</li>
                <li>The proteins coalesced and formed colloids.</li>
                <li>Proteins and lipids formed a "cell membrane" that enclosed the organic&nbsp;compounds, to form a
                    primitive cell.</li>
                <li>The cell was surrounded by organic molecules that it fed on&nbsp;heterotrophically.</li>
                <li>This took place in water.</li>
                <li>From this cell progressively autotrophs evolved.</li>
                <li>That were similar to blue-green algae.</li>
                <li>They produced oxygen and as more oxygen was evolved ozone layer formed&nbsp;an blocked ultra violet
                    radiation.</li>
                <li>This allowed formation of present day photo-autotrophs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="spaced"><a id="EvidenceforOrganicEvolution">Evidence for Organic Evolution</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Most of the evidence for evolution is <strong>indirect.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;i.e. it is based on
                    studies carried out on present-day animals and plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Direct evidence</strong> is obtained from studying the remains of animals and plants&nbsp;of
                    the past.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="spaced"><strong>Fossil Records</strong></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The study of fossils is called paleontology.</li>
                <li>Fossils are remains of organisms that lived in ancient times.</li>
                <li>Most fossils are remains of hard parts of the body such as bones, teeth, shells&nbsp;and
                    exoskeletons.</li>
                <li>Some fossils are just impressions of the body parts, e.g. footprints,&nbsp;leaf-vennation patterns,
                    etc.</li>
                <li>Fossils are usually found in sedimentary rocks which have been formed by&nbsp;deposition of
                    sediments over millions of years.</li>
                <li>The deeper the layer of sediments, the older the fossils found in that layer.</li>
                <li>Modem man, <em>Homo sapiens</em>, evolved from ape-like creatures 25 million years&nbsp;ago.</li>
                <li>These evolved to upright, tool using creature called <em>Australopithecus afarensis</em>&nbsp;which
                    had a cranial capacity of 400-500 cc.</li>
                <li>This evolved through several intermediates; <em>Homo habilis</em> and <em>Homo erectus</em>
                    to&nbsp;modem day human.</li>
                <li><em>Homo sapiens</em> has a cranial capacity of 1350 - 1450 cc.</li>
                <li><em>Homo sapiens</em> is more intelligent.</li>
                <li>Main features in human evolution include bipedal posture, is an omnivore and&nbsp;has an opposable
                    thumb.<br><img class="jch-lazyload"

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Limitations of the Fossil Evidence</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Only <strong>partial preservation</strong> was usually possible because softer parts
                    decayed.&nbsp;The fossil records are therefore incomplete.</li>
                <li><strong>Distortion</strong> - parts of organisms might have become flattened
                    during&nbsp;sedimentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Subsequent geological activities</strong> e.g. erosion, earthquakes, faulting
                    and&nbsp;uplifting may have destroyed some fossils.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Geographical Distribution</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Until about 250 million years ago, all the land masses on earth formed a single&nbsp;land mass
                    (Pangaea).</li>
                <li>This is thought to have undergone continental drift, splitting into different&nbsp;continents.</li>
                <li>Consequently, organisms in certain regions became geographically isolated&nbsp;and did not have a
                    chance to interbreed with other organisms in other&nbsp;regions.</li>
                <li>Such organisms underwent evolution in isolation and have become&nbsp;characteristically different
                    from organisms in other regions.</li>
                <li>For example, pouched mammals (e.g. kangaroo, wallaby, koala bear) are&nbsp;found almost exclusively
                    in Australia.</li>
                <li>The opossum is the only surviving representative of the pouched mammals in&nbsp;North America.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Comparative Embryology</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>During the early stages of development, the embryos of different vertebrates&nbsp;are almost
                    indistinguishable.</li>
                <li>Fish, amphibian, bird and mammalian embryos have similar, features,&nbsp;indicating that they arose
                    from a common ancestor.</li>
                <li>Similarities include:&nbsp;Visceral clefts, segmental muscle blocks (myotomes) and a single
                    circulation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Comparative Anatomy</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Comparative anatomy is the study of organs in different species with the aim&nbsp;of establishing
                    whether the organism are related.</li>
                <li>Organisms which have the same basic features are thought to have arisen&nbsp;from a <strong>common
                        ancestor.</strong></li>
                <li>The vertebrate <strong>pentadactyl limb</strong> evolved in different ways as an adaptation&nbsp;to
                    different modes of life.&nbsp;e.g. as a flipper in whales, as a wing in bats and as a digging hand
                    in moles.<br><img class="jch-lazyload"

                <li>Such organs are said to be <strong>homologous</strong>, i.e. they have arisen from a&nbsp;common
                    ancestor but they have assumed different functions.&nbsp;This is an example of <strong>divergent
                        evolution.</strong></li>
                <li>The wing of a butterfly and that of a bird are said to be <strong>analogous,</strong>&nbsp;i.e. they
                    have originated from different ancestors but they perform the same&nbsp;function.</li>
                <li>This is an example of <strong>convergent evolution.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Cell Biology</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>All eucaryotic cells have organelles such as mitochondria, membrane-bound&nbsp;nuclei, ribosomes,
                    golgi bodies.</li>
                <li>Thus indicating that different organisms have a common ancestor.</li>
                <li>The presence of chloroplasts and cellulose cell walls indicates that green&nbsp;plants have a common
                    ancestor.</li>
                <li>Blood pigments are conjugated proteins with a metal group.</li>
                <li>Similar pigments are found in different animal groups .&nbsp;e.g. haemoglobin is found in all
                    vertebrates and in annelida (earthworm).</li>
                <li>This shows that all animals have a common origin.</li>
            </ul> 
            <h2 class="spaced"><a id="MechanismofEvolution">Mechanism of Evolution</a></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The mechanism of evolution can be described as a process of <strong>natural&nbsp;selection acting on
                        the heritable variations that occur among the members&nbsp;</strong><strong>of a
                        population.</strong></li>
                <li>A population consists of a group of individuals of the same species.</li>
                <li>Each individual has a set of hereditary factors(genes).</li>
                <li>All the genes in a population constitute a gene pool.</li>
                <li>When reproduction takes place, genes pair with one another randomly.</li>
                <li>Genes which occur in great numbers in the gene pool, will occur in greater&nbsp;numbers in the next
                    generation.</li>
                <li>Several theories have been proposed over the years to explain how evolution&nbsp;took place.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a id="LamarksTheory">Lamark’s Theory</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Lamark had observed that if a part of the body of an organism was used&nbsp;extensively, it became
                    enlarged and more efficient;</li>
                <li>If a part of the body was not fully used, it would degenerate.</li>
                <li>By use and disuse of various body parts, the organism would change and&nbsp;acquire certain
                    characteristics.</li>
                <li>He suggested that these characteristics would them be passed on to the&nbsp;offspring(next
                    generation).</li>
                <li>In 1809, lamark published his book <strong>"Theory Of Evolution".</strong></li>
                <li>He proposed that new life forms arise from use and disuse of parts of existing&nbsp;organisms and
                    through the inheritance of acquired characteristics.</li>
                <li>Lamark’s theory has been disapproped in that although use and disuse of&nbsp;parts does lead to
                    acquired characteristics, such characteristics are not&nbsp;inheritable since they are effects

            <ul>
                <li>In 1859, Charles Darwin published his theory of evolution’ in a book called&nbsp;origin of species
                    by means of natural selection’.</li>
                <li>Darwin’s theory was based on the following evidence;the population of a&nbsp;given species remains
                    constant over a long period of time.</li>
                <li>The number of young ones is more than the number of adults.</li>
                <li>More offsprings are produced than can possibly survive.</li>
                <li>Variation occurs withing a given population,i.e all members of the same&nbsp;species are not alike.
                </li>
                <li>On the basis of these observations, Darwin made the following conclusions; <ul>
                        <li>There is a struggle for existence among individuals in a given population.</li>
                        <li>Individuals who are not suitably adapted (e.i. who have unfavourable&nbsp;variations)are
                            less able to pass their characteristics to the next generation.</li>
                        <li>Natural selection operates on the population, selecting those individuals
                            with&nbsp;favourable variations;</li>
                        <li>i.e. environment favours individuals that are more adapted.</li>
                        <li>They win competition e.g. for food and survive.i.e. ‘ ’survival of the fittest’’ .</li>
                        <li>They attain sexual maturity and pass on the characteristics to their offsprings.</li>
                    </ul>

            <p><strong>Peppered moth (Industrial melanism)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The peppered moth, Biston betularia , exists in two distinct forms;</li>
                <li>A speckled white form(the normal form) and the melanic, dark form.</li>
                <li>The moths normally rest on the tree trunks and branches where they are&nbsp;camouflaged against
                    predators.</li>
                <li>The first melanic moths were observed in 1848 around Manchester in Britain.</li>
                <li>Since that time, their numbers has increased tremendously, out-numbering&nbsp;the speckled white
                    form.</li>
                <li>The increase in the population of the melanic form is correlated with environmental changes brought
                    about by industrialization and pollution.</li>
                <li>Smoke and soot from factories have darkened the tree trunks over the years.</li>
                <li>This has resulted in the preservation of the mutation in Biston betularia&nbsp;leading to the
                    evolution of the melanic form.</li>
                <li>This form is almost invisible against the dark background of the tree trunks&nbsp;and is less
                    subject to predation than the speckled form.</li>
                <li>The peppered form is more abundant in areas away from the soot and smoke&nbsp;of factories.</li>
                <li>This is because it is well camouflaged by the lichen-covered tree trunks against&nbsp;which it rests
                    and is therefore not easily detected by predators.</li>
                <li>The existence of two or more distinct forms within a species (as exemplified&nbsp;by Biston
                    betularia) is called <strong>polymorphism.</strong></li>

            <p><strong>Resistance to Drugs</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Certain strains of organisms have developed resistance to drugs and&nbsp;antibiotics.</li>
                <li>Following continued use of such drugs and antibiotics, some of the&nbsp;individuals in a population
                    of bacteria or other microorganisms survive and&nbsp;are able to pass their characteristics to the
                    next generation.</li>
                <li>When a patient fails to take full dosage of the antibiotics prescribed the&nbsp;pathogen develops
                    resistance to the drugs hence become difficult to control.</li>
                <li>Some mosquitoes have developed resistance to certain pesticides.</li>

                <li>Their anatomy can be studied.</li>
                <li>The following can be noted: <ul>
                        <li>That all limbs have five sets of bones;</li>
                        <li>A single upper bone- the femur in hind limb and the humerus in fore limb</li>
                        <li>Two lower limb bones -i.e. the tibia &amp; fibula in the hind limb &amp; ulna &amp; radius
                            in&nbsp;the forelimb.</li>
                        <li>Small bones - i.e. ankle (tarsals) and wrist bones (carpals)</li>
                        <li>The bones making the foot and hand are metatarsals and metacarpals&nbsp;respectively.</li>
                        <li>The bones of toes and of fingers i.e. phalanges</li>

                <li>Observe the various modifications of these bones in the various animals.</li>
                <li>Limbs of different mammals e.g. rabbit, cow, donkey reveal that the anatomy&nbsp;is adapted to mode
                    or type of movement.&nbsp;e.g. the horse has a single digit.</li>
                <li>An outdoor activity to observe various styles of movement in different&nbsp;mammals can be studied
